        1. The template with the structure of the email:
        {template_msg} 

        2. Details about the company, HR, or contact in JSON format, some information might not be there so don't take part of that component from the above template. Also some instruction might be there which you need to follow in the below data:
        {data}

        3. If the details are enough about the compnay or the contact person then include that otherwise don't, though you can include the company name in the subject always

        3. Ensure the email signature is exactly as follows:
    
        --
        Manas Poddar
        üìß Email: iamscientistmanas@gmail.com, manas@scienmanas.xyz
        üêô Github: https://github.com/scienmanas
        üåê Web: https://scienmanas.xyz

        4. Format the email response properly:
            - Use escape sequences (`\\n`) to break lines or paragraphs.
            - Do not split or break the lines improperly use as it in template

        The response must be in JSON format as described below:
        {{
            "subject": "Subject of the email with company name",
            "body": "Body of the email."
        }}

        5. The generated email should be ready to send without review, so ensure it's perfect, no typos, no grammatical errors, no formatting issues, no [fill it here] things. If information is not sufficient enough just ignore that part don't include it in email. Also if no information is mentioned about the company or contact then just ignore that part and don't include it in email.
        
        6. Keep the email length small and concise.

        Generate the email carefully by following these instructions.
        '''

        # Get email by ai
        ai_response = get_ai_response(prompt=prompt)
        send_email(email=data.get('email') ,ai_response=ai_response, focused_on=focused_on) 
        

# Start the system
print("Starting the system...")
